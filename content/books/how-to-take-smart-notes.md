## Meta
- Progress: 70%
- Writing notes about a book teaching me how to write notes is a very interesting experience
- What's the best software to emulate this system? 
- How to easily include graphs, video snippets, images?
- Transcribed pg 1-2
- Need to automate *the copy-paste portions of this process*

## High level concepts
-  If you don't rephrase something in your words, you probably don't care enough to learn it
- With every use of a "slip-box" (zettelkasten note structure system) use you are reinforcing the exact same structure within your own mind


## My own notes (mostly unorganized)
- writing is important because it's where the thinking actually happens
- bad note-taking is easy because of a lack of tight feedback loops
- starting from a blank page **is** hard and has little to do with the skill level of the author
    - might this apply to code? How does programming ability improve when we have boilerplate projects, functions, and modules available? 
- The slip-box
    - allows us to trust it without fear of losing things
    - makes switching between tasks and context easier
    - Organization
        - one-sided notes
        - few index entry nodes
        - non-linear numbering system to tie disparate nodes together
        - non-hierarchical 
        - regular review & processing
    - Not completely comparable to [[hyperlink]]s
        - Explore this further: how is it different? Any value in adding a "note about a connection"? Is this a valid definition of a note in the first place?
    - **Key ability is adding one note to many other contexts**
    - Builds a "latticework" of ideas
        - A structure to add new ideas to existing ideas by giving them a place to "dock to"
        - Reinforces the same structure in your own brain as you use it
        - The more developed it is, the easier to add more content to it
        - Forces us to ask the key questions which make learning and understanding possible
            - What does it mean?
            - How does this relate to...?
            - How is this similar to...?
            - What's the difference between...?
- On writing well
    - Separate your tasks into stages
    - Outlining vs finding words vs proofreading all take different attention forms and attempting them simultaneously will result in sadness
        - Separate the processes of creation from improving. You can’t write and edit, or sculpt and polish, or make and analyze at the same time. If you do, the editor stops the creator. While you invent, don’t select. While  you sketch, don’t inspect. While you write the first draft, don’t reflect. At the start, the creator mind must be unleashed from judgement.  
            - https://kk.org/thetechnium/68-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/
    - Doing good academic work is antithetical to rigid form and structure. Over time you develop a a sense for fruitful vs wasteful avenues for exploration
- On learning 
    - Requires being able to restate an idea in your own words without tripping up on gaps
    - Rote memorization or reading through content almost never provides that
    - Rewriting things as we're learning them create a "do-I-understand-this" feedback loop
    - Writing concrete one-off notes (~5/day) has compound interest payoff. It is also a reasonable way of measuring [[productivity]]
- Anatomy of a [[note]]
    - Full sentences
    - Disclose your sources
    - Make references
    - Try to be precise 
    - Clear and brief
    - Written as if for someone else
- GTD vs smart note-taking
    - GTD -> relies on clear objectives and definitions for completion
    - Smart note-taking -> starts with vague insights 

## Highlights (imported from Readwise [[May 1st, 2020]])
- The first time one faces the challenge of writing a long text, say a dissertation, it is pretty normal to feel intimidated by the prospective of filling a few hundred pages with well-conceived ideas, source-based research and correct references on every page. If you don’t feel some kind of respect for this task, there is something wrong with you.
- Coherent arguments require the language to be fixed, and only if something is written down is it fixed enough to be discussed independently from the author.
- It is not surprising, therefore, that the best-researched and most successful learning method is elaboration. It is very similar to what we do when we take smart notes and combine them with others, which is the opposite of mere re-viewing (Stein et al. 1984)
    - Connection to Stian email?
- Plus, exercise reduces stress, which is good, because stress floods our brains with hormones that suppress learning processes (Baram et al. 2008).
    - Why might that be evolutionarily speaking?
- The only difference is that the audience here consists of our future selves, which will very soon have reached the same state of ignorance as someone who never had access to what we have written about.
- In fact, it is almost impossible to write anything interesting and worth publishing (and therefore motivating) if it is based on nothing else than an idea we were able to come up with up front before elaborating on the problem.
- Only if the work itself becomes rewarding can the dynamic of motivation and reward become self-sustainable and propel the whole process forward (DePasque and Tricomi, 2015).
- The notes are no longer reminders of thoughts or ideas, but contain the actual thought or idea in written form. This is a crucial difference.
- Truth does not belong to anyone; it is the outcome of the scientific exchange of written ideas. This is why the presentation and the production of knowledge cannot be separated, but are rather two sides of the same coin (Peters and Schäfer 2006, 9).
- There is no such thing as private knowledge in academia. An idea kept private is as good as one you never had. And a fact no one can reproduce is no fact at all. Making something public always means to write it down so it can be read. There is no such thing as a history of unwritten ideas.
- The more you become interested in something, the more you will read and think about it, the more notes you will collect and the more likely it is that you will generate questions from it.
- The idea is not to collect, but to develop ideas, arguments and discussions. Does the new information contradict, correct, support or add to what you already have (in the slip-box or on your mind)? Can you combine ideas to generate something new? What questions are triggered by them?
- If you want to learn something for the long run, you have to write it down. If you want to really understand something, you have to translate it into your own words.
- unsuitable for an open-ended process like research, thinking or studying in general,
    - Ref andy article
- A good structure allows you to do that, to move seamlessly from one task to another – without threatening the whole arrangement or losing sight of the bigger picture.
    - What is that?
- Every task that is interesting, meaningful and well-defined will be done, because there is no conflict between long- and short-term interests. Having a meaningful and well-defined task beats willpower every time.
- What does make a significant difference along the whole intelligence spectrum is something else: how much self-discipline or self-control one uses to approach the tasks at hand (Duckworth and Seligman, 2005; Tangney, Baumeister, and Boone, 2004).
- Getting something that is already written into another written piece is incomparably easier than assembling everything in your mind and then trying to retrieve it from there.
- What can we do differently in the weeks, months or even years before we face the blank page that will get us into the best possible position to write a great paper easily?
- There is another reason that note-taking flies mostly under the radar: We don’t experience any immediate negative feedback if we do it badly.
- Writing is not what follows research, learning or studying, it is the medium of all this work.
